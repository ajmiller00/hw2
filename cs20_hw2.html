			<h3 align="center"> About The Project </h3>
			<p align="center"> In June 2018, I concluded my fifth instrument donation drive since 2012! This drive was an extension of my bat mitzvah project, which I conducted in 2013, and have continued to do periodically. Through a partnership with Berklee College of Music, the instruments I collect are donated to local nonprofit organizations and schools which provide music education to underserved populations. </p>
			<p align="center"> This organization collects quality computer hardware, musical instruments, and production equipment to communities in need. Examples of their partner organizations include the Boys and Girls Clubs, various Boston Public Schools, the Haley House, Girls Rock Campaign and several locations of YMCAs. These organizations work to bring music and music education to underserved populations, especially urban youth. The Haley House specifically serves populations dealing with homelessness and poverty by empowering girls through music, such as Girls Rock Campaign. </p>
			<p align="center"> One of the clubhouses that the instruments go to, the Mattapan Teen Center, was able to start a brass ensemble as a result of the instruments I donated in my 2016 instrument drive. This was very exciting news to hear! </p>

			<h3 align="center"> About Me </h3>
			<p align="center"> I am currently a student at Tufts University, and grew up in Newton, MA. I have been playing saxophone since the fourth grade, and have loved it since the day I started.  Helping kids get the chance to enjoy music as much as I do is something very near to my heart. By collecting instruments to donate, it is my hope that others will have the opportunity to share the same joy in music. </p>
